# Anki-Def-Updater
This was my attemp to make my anki cards better, by choosing which definitions from a dictionary, based on the most recent note added.
NOTE: There's a better version of this which is a proper anki addon. So I do not recommend this.

You'll need a folder named "Dicitonaries" that contains the unzipped folder "大辞林"

Top Button functions:

"Last Note" - Uses AnkiConnect to get the most recent note, get the word in the "focus" field and searches jp definitions in 大辞林 and displays the results. Need to make it clean the previous results before running again.

"CLipboard" - Copies what's in the clipboard and pastes it in the box.

"Search" - Does nothing at the moment. The idea is to make it search the dictionary when you have a word in the clipboard box.

"Exit" - Closes the program. Why not?


It now adds the clicked definition into anki.
